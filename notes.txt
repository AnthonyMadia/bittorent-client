Most trackers use UDP because of performance reasons. Http is build on top of TCP.
TCP guarantees that when a user sends data, the other user will receive that data in correct order -- but must create persistent connection between users before sending data which can make TCP slower than UDP.
Use TCP for file transfer between peers because those files tend to be larger and must arrive intact.
